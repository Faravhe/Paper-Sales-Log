[Feature 1: Autocomplete for Client Names]
"First, let’s look at the client input field. As I start typing, you’ll see autocomplete suggestions based on predefined clients like Shake Shack, Toast, and the Computer Science Department. If I type a new client name, like 'Starbucks,' it gets added to the autocomplete list for future use."

[Code Snippet: Autocomplete Setup]
"Here’s the code that makes this work. We use jQuery UI’s autocomplete feature. The source is dynamically updated whenever a new client is added."
javascript
Copy

$("#client").autocomplete({
    source: clients,
    minLength: 0
});

[Feature 2: Adding a New Sale]
"Now, let’s add a new sale. I’ll enter 'Starbucks' as the client and '500' as the number of reams. When I click 'Submit,' the new sale appears at the top of the list. You can also press 'Enter' in the reams field to submit."

[Code Snippet: Adding a Sale]
"Here’s the function that handles adding a sale. It validates the inputs, updates the sales array, and re-renders the list."
javascript
Copy

function addSale() {
    const client = $("#client").val().trim();
    const reams = $("#reams").val().trim();

    if (!client || !reams || isNaN(reams)) {
        alert("Please enter valid inputs.");
        return;
    }

    sales.unshift({ client, reams: parseInt(reams), salesperson });
    renderSales();
}

[Feature 3: Deleting a Sale]
"To delete a sale, I can click the 'Delete' button next to any row. For example, let’s delete the 'Shake Shack' sale. The row disappears instantly."

[Code Snippet: Deleting a Sale]
"Deletion is handled by removing the item from the sales array and re-rendering the list. Each row has a data-id attribute to track its position."
javascript
Copy

$(document).on("click", ".delete-btn", function () {
    const id = $(this).closest(".sale-row").data("id");
    sales.splice(id, 1);
    renderSales();
});

[Feature 4: Drag-and-Drop to Trash]
"Another way to delete a sale is by dragging it to the trash. Watch as I drag the 'Toast' sale to the trash. When I drop it, the sale is removed."

[Code Snippet: Drag-and-Drop Setup]
"Here’s the code for making rows draggable and the trash droppable. When a row is dropped, its data-id is used to remove it from the sales array."
javascript
Copy

$(".sale-row").draggable({
    revert: "invalid",
    cursor: "move"
});

$("#trash").droppable({
    accept: ".sale-row",
    hoverClass: "bg-warning",
    drop: function (event, ui) {
        const id = ui.draggable.data("id");
        sales.splice(id, 1);
        renderSales();
    }
});

[Feature 5: Input Validation]
"If I try to submit without entering a client or reams, or if I enter an invalid number, the site shows an alert and prevents submission."

[Code Snippet: Input Validation]
"Here’s the validation logic. It checks for empty fields and invalid numbers."
javascript
Copy

if (!client) {
    alert("Please enter a client name.");
    $("#client").focus();
    return;
}
if (!reams || isNaN(reams)) {
    alert("Please enter a valid number of reams.");
    $("#reams").focus();
    return;
}
